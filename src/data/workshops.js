      Advanced React Patterns with Hooks is an ADVANCED workshop. Making React
      components that can be used in multiple places is not hard. What is hard
      is when the use cases differ. Without the right patterns, you can find
      yourself with a highly complex component that requires a lot of
      configuration props and way too many if statements.
      
      With this course, you'll not only learn great patterns you can use but
      also the strengths and weaknesses of each, so you know which to reach for
      to provide your components the flexibility and power you need. If you're
      already experienced with React, you'll enjoy the fact that this is all
      using React's latest "Hooks" feature which makes these patterns even
      better and even introduces some new ones.

      Developing and deploying production applications with React is one thing, but being confident that you're not

      I have personally written tens of thousands of tests for production applications and my open source modules.

      This course is for React newbies and those looking to get a better understanding of React fundamentals.
      With a focus on React fundamentals, you'll come out of this course knowing what problems React can solve
      for you and how it goes about solving those problems. You will have a good grasp on what JSX is and how
      it translates to regular JavaScript function calls and objects.

      Each lesson in this course is just a single \`index.html\` file which will help you keep your focus on
      learning React and not distracted by all the tools that make production applications work. The course
      wraps up with a lesson on how to move from these \`index.html\` files to a more production ready development
      environment and even how to deploy your app to a great service like Netlify.

      Enjoy!

      something I've created, and hearing that others are using it in their applications is incredible. But writing and
      managing an open source project is challenging. I want to help you get started with open source or improve your
      current projects with some of the things I've learned by publishing and maintaining over 60 npm packages.

      - Learn how to set up a new project locally and on GitHub for development
      - Learn how to configure npm for publishing the project to the npm registry
      - Learn how to transpile the source with babel
      - Learn how to add unit tests and code coverage
      - Learn how to add CI (with Travis CI) to run tests automatically and report coverage stats to codecov.io
      - Learn how to automate releases with semantic-release
      - Learn how to distribute a browser build with webpack

      "Feel free to submit a PR!" - words often found in GitHub issues, but met with confusion and fear by many.
      Getting started with contributing open source is not always straightforward and can be tricky. With this series,
      you'll be equipped with the the tools, knowledge, and understanding you need to be productive and contribute to
      the wonderful world of open source projects. Much of this series speaks about GitHub, but most of the concepts
      are generally applicable to contributing to any open source project, regardless of where it's hosted.

      So enjoy the course and start contributing to the projects you use and love today!

      How much work would it take for you to move all of your directives and their templates to several different new
      directories? You'd have to update the templateUrl, script tags, etc., etc. With webpack, this can be trivial. For
      example, you don't need to worry about loading your templates in the $templateCache ever again. Webpack will help
      you modularize your css and tests. All of these things and more in this series so you can start using webpack
      with Angular today.

      JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a more modern approach to authentication. As the web moves to a greater separation
      between the client and server, JWT provides a terrific alternative to traditional cookie based authentication
      models. For more information on JWT visit http://jwt.io/

      In this series, we'll be building a simple application to get random user information from a node server with an
      Angular client. We'll then implement JWT to protect the random user resource on the server and then work through
      the frontend to get JWT authentication working.

      By the end, we'll have an application which has a single username/password combination (for simplicity) and uses
      tokens to authorize the client to see the random user information. You'll be able to login, get random users, and
      logout.

      AngularJS is one of the most popular frontend frameworks out there right now. If you haven't tried it yet,
      prepare to be amazed! Here's what we'll cover:

      1. Templates/Expressions - Your View
      2. Module - Your app's namespace
      3. Directives - DOM Interface
      4. Filters - Display utils
      5. Scope - What on earth is this thing!?
      6. Controllers - The View Model
      7. Services - Common utilities
      8. Working with third-party modules
      9. Routing - Single Page App with state in the URL
      10. Firebase & AngularFire - A full web application with no server setup required!

      We'll be following through a repository hosted on GitHub. There's a branch for each concept, so you can play
      around with the code and then catch right back up with the next branch. So come on, and let's learn AngularJS!
