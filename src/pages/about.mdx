# Hi! I'm Kent 👋

I'm a software engineer and teacher. I was born in 1988 (you can do the math)
and grew up in Idaho. After graduating High School and serving a 2 year mission
in the Missouri Independence Mission for
[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org),
I went to [BYU](https://byu.edu) where I graduated with both a Bachelor and
Master's degree in Information Systems with an emphasis on Software Application
Development.

I've written code for
[More Good Foundation](https://www.moregoodfoundation.org),
[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org),
[USAA](https://www.usaa.com), [Domo](https://domo.com),
[Parakeet](http://goparakeet.com), [Workfront](https://www.workfront.com),
[Alianza](https://www.alianza.com), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/home),
and [my open source code](https://github.com/kentcdodds) has been used by
millions of people all over the globe.

**I now work for myself full-time as an educator.** I create content all about
Web Development on various platforms including:
[egghead.io](https://kcd.im/egghead), [Frontend Masters](https://kcd.im/fem),
[YouTube](https://kcd.im/youtube), [Twitter](https://kcd.im/twitter), and my own
sites like [TestingJavaScript.com](https://testingjavascript.com) 🏆

While in school at BYU, I met my wife Brooke. We live in Utah with our four kids
and dog 👧👦👦👦🐶.
