I focus on JavaScript for the browser and Node. I'm pretty into React, Testing,
tooling, and Babel. My weekly emails reflect this preference. I'll occasionally
give career advice as well. It's normally pretty brief and reflects what I'm
learning and currently working on, or what people are asking me on
[my AMA](https://kcd.im/ama).

  I will not sell your email address to spammers. I will occasionally send
  emails outside the regular cadence.
